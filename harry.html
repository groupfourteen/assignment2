										</header>
										<p>Harrison currently resides in Melbourne, and after VCE completed a year of Bachelor or Psychology, before deciding to pursue his interest in Information Technology, while also  working as a baker's apprentice.  When he's not rolling dough his enjoys listening to and playing music, reading, and gaming online with friends.  His interest in information technology was stirred from youth, and he learned a great deal from his father who was more tech savvy than most, learning about things like running from the command line to use dosbox.  This interest grew more in primary and high school, where Harrison found himself being Mr-fix-it for everyone else's It issues, thus enabling him to delve deeper into his own understanding of computers and systems.  He found a natural affinity with computers, and also learnt he really enjoyed being able to help others and fix their issues.  He pursued this interest further and taught himself HTML coding and python language, however bakers hours don't currently allow him much chance to continue this interest.  He has decided to undertake a Bachelor of IT, as he believes there is great potential for him to find employment in an area he thoroughly enjoys, with the longer term goals of finding work in areas such as coding, connectivity systems, and servers and networking.   </p>
