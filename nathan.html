											<h1>Nathan Christos</h1>
											<p></p>
										</header>
										<p>Currently based in sunny Queensland where he works with electronic security and surveillance issues, Nathan originally grew up in a farming community in NSW.  He was home schooled from a young age and it seems his quest for learning and knowledge was present from his early youth, as he continuously scored well above the curriculum standards. Eventually his natural curiosity for learning crossed paths with IT in the form of his family's first computer.  Nathan realised that computers were not magic, but machines, that could be understood and mastered.  He has followed this curiosity with IT  to a career in electronics, and plans to continue building on his insatiable quest for understanding by studying his Bachelor of Information Technology.  Already being involved in electronics through his career, Nathan has many ideas for IT based projects and hope through further study he could bring these to fruition.  His strong desire to always improve and master his skills has also been applied to his many and varied other interests which include archery, playing music professionally, being a Kung Fu Master, and being able to solve a rubik's cube!  </p>
