										<p>The seed for the idea of a career in IT was first planted in Cory at the young age of 10, by playing Halo: Combat Evolved on the XBOX.  Unlike most other players at the time who just enjoyed the gameplay, Cory was intrigued by more than the game itself, but everything going on behind it:  the hardware, the game mechanics, programming, the design.  The seed took root and he pursed this interest further and while a teenager he learnt programming and even made his own "terrible 3d Games" to learn more about the craft around his passion.  Fast forward to today and Cory passion about game design has only increased.  Cory sees the potential for 3D art and design to be better and bolder, and he sees his current studies with RMIT as a big step towards learning more about his passion.  His other main interests  which he also approaches with passion and creativity are coffee and metal music.
