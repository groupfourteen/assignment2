											<h1>Lee van den Blink</h1>
											<p></p>
										</header>
										<p>With a decade long history in the vocational education sector, Lee has worked with database management and server management in both small and medium businesses.  She is passionate about 'clean data' and using data analysis to paint a picture of what is really happening in a company based on the database information.  Lee has also rolled out numerous upgrades to IT infrastructure and been responsible for training staff in new application and software.  She was first exposed to computers through playing 80s adventure games with friends in primary school, and as technology improved her curiosity and involvement with technology has only increased.  Being a teenager when floppy discs and dial up internet were still a thing, Lee sees that the world of IT has evolved so vastly and there's so much more to learn, and she wants to learn as much about it as she can.   Being that technology and computers have been a part of her life for so long, it's no great surprise that Lee is an avid gamer in her spare time, which is somewhat limited these days as she's also looking after her young family while working part time.  Alongside video games she also enjoys playing netball and learning more about the world through listening to any number of the shows in her massive podcast library.
