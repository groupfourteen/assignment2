Initially I had believed my opinion of my ideal job would've changed somewhat but that's not the case. I have just become more aware of what skills, characteristics and experience are most sought after in the industry that would more likely result in a higher appreciation by employers and potentially better pay rates. Again, these statistics haven't altered my ideals. I'm infatuated with creativity and though I'd still be very content working for companies on code bases, given the choice, I'd always find myself working for a company developing video games in any aspect - assuming the pay is realistic.

My experience is limited and there is a lot of knowledge I will need to accumulate during my time in the industry before my skills and experience are demmed useful to any developing studios but that is something I'd accepted when I had initially enrolled into RMIT.
