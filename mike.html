											<h1>Michael ...</h1>
											<p></p>
										</header>
										<p>After leaving Australia 7 years ago on a one way ticket to travel the world, Michael currently calls Moscow his city of residence, where he teaches English.  He main interest is the pursuit of knowledge.  A Bachelor of Arts graduate, Michael has continued his education into the IT industry, with a keen interest in learning more about software engineering.  Seldom does he have downtime, as when he is not at work, he is often studying university, or any number of other online education.  You could say studying is his biggest hobby, as he has completed numerous online courses to further his own knowledge on subjects, including maths, computer science and programming languages.  Like many members of Group Fourteen, his interest in IT was first piqued at a young age with the family computer.  He has witnessed the speed of evolution of the industry, and now understands that the world of IT has the ability to influence society, seeing first hand the differences between countries that have supported infrastructure, and those that are lacking.  A few years ago Michael decided to remove himself from all social media, feeling the intrusiveness and ambiguity of the services far outweighed any benefit.  This directly links with his interest in cybersecurity and privacy issues, where he hopes to specialise in his future career.  </p>
