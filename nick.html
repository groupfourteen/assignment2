											<h1> Nicholas Youn</h1>
											<p></p>
										</header>
										<p>Young in name and in age, but don't let that deceive you.  After completing high school Nicholas continued to pursue his interest in IT and studied both IT Networking and Level Design, and it currently studying his Bachelor of IT at RMIT.   He discovered his natural affinity for all things IT while still young at high school, when he fixed a troublesome network issue using nothing but research and tenacity.   Nicholas has self-taught himself many skills along the way through helping people with their own IT issues, which he then uses as an opportunity to further develop his own knowledge.  In particular he has applied his self-learning ability to game level design, which he has pursued for a number of years, and has successfully designed his own levels for games.  Aside from his pursuing further knowledge in game design he is also very interesting in developing his knowledge on IT networking.  </p>
