For the group project for the assignment 2, group 14, I felt that we had very good communication and team work skills overall, and produced a great work ethic throughout. As we all had the same interest coming into the project, I believe this greatly improved our communication abilities and improved our team work ability. I felt that no major problems were met in our group during our work, due to our communication through discord, and always keeping each other informed and up to date on where we were and how everything was going, along with everyone’s roles and what needed to be done and when. This group project has shown me that a good open-line of communication can make all the difference when it comes to a groups effectiveness and work flow, and that when everyone has a mutual interest it can also improve the groups cohesion and work effectiveness, especially on a creative endeavor, as it can reduce clashes and speed up work efficiency. Due to my work I feel I could have been slightly more communicative and have more input, which I will have to work on and improve in further work.
