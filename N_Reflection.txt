During this group project I felt that our group’s organization skills and work output was very good with little in the way of ways to improve outside of possibly some minor ways we could have had structured our communication a little better – though this was no issue in our group as our communication overall was generally on point. I was surprised by the fact that we ran into no major problems as my experience with group work in the past has been somewhat negative. Any potential issues were avoided thanks to our communication which was assisted greatly by Discord which gave us an always-open line of communication to each other which we could use to talk or ask questions at any time. Something I learned from this group project was how a good communication tool could make things a lot easier. Prior to this assignment the last group assignment I did was done almost completely through organized skype sessions, and we had barely any ways of communicating with each other out side of those sessions which inevitably lead to problems. Good communication tools let you tackle problems and get work done with others whenever and where ever, leading to a more effective group overall.
