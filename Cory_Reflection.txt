Throughout this group project I've seen great form in organisation and cooperation between members. There were no substantial indifferences with one another making it very easy to communicate while sharing ideas and concepts, and making group decisions. I feel there weren't any tertiary issues as a group either; though there are time zone differences between some members we have had no issues with completing work and keeping in touch thanks to the ease of use with Discord. Being able to drop into chat at any point in time really mitigates the issue of falling behind topic or losing past conversations; it's all semi-permanantly logged in server chats.
As such this experience as a group has really shown me how important communication and a good medium for communication really is. Without it organisation would be extremely difficult and would be detrimental to work flow.
I feel there is still more room for improvement for myself. Learning to use Github has been my greatest hurdle and had I initially shown more interest in it's use and application I may have had less issues with it. This will be something I keep in mind in future when I'm presented with different obstacles or scenarios I don't fully understand.
